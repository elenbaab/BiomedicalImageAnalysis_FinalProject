# Biomedical Image Analysis: Final Project

### Runnable scripts/commands: what are the main commands that you run to get the results
We utilized Google Drive to access our dataset, so to run the script one would have to download our dataset to their own (or shared) Google Drive. As for scripts/commands, everything is on the .ipnyb file. The first section contains necessary modules and installations to be performed, which is simple to follow.

### Contribution: who is responsible for which files
We used a .ipnyb file in order to modularize and block our code, so we coule use solely one file. Our team worked on our code all together, meeting regularly.
